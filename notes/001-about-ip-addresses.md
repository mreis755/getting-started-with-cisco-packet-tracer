# On IP Addresses

The IP addresses for End Devices range from 192.168.0.2 to 192.168.0.254. Each NIC will get a unique IP address in the same network.

The subnet mask is used to differentiate the host and the network ID portion of the IP address.

The first three numbers of an IP address is the network ID portion of that address, and the fourth number is the host port of the IP address, or the number that represents the device connected on the network.

The maximum number of devices that can be connected to a network is 253, with the host ports ranging from 2 to 254.
